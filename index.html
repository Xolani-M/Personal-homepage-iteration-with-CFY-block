         <p class="paragraph">
            Growing up as a little boy, you do not really know or understand much, but what is mostly clear even in that young age is what you <strong>desire</strong> to become and what you want out of life. One of the most exciting things
            i enjoyed as a kid was indulging in the <strong>idea</strong> of growing up to be a <strong>writer</strong>, to <strong>create</strong> and to <strong>build</strong> stuff. With the oblivion of rejection, limitations and fear,
            everything i desired seemed within reach. Well it was until i affiliated myself with the world and met cruelty, disaster and disappointment.
         </p>

         <p class="paragraph">
            What i am most grateful for is that through all the different phases i went through in life my<strong> desires</strong> and<strong> vision</strong> never faded away... <strong>faith</strong> kept me going and along the way i
            picked up some <strong>virtues</strong>, <strong>courage</strong>, and a <strong>purpose</strong>. Learning for me became an essential <strong>skill</strong> that helped me through difficult situations, without the
            <strong>knowledge</strong> acquired i would'nt be the person that i am today, hence the saying goes <strong>'The knowledge of the truth shall set you free'</strong>. In my journey i became a student of many things including
            <strong>computer programming</strong>. Now this is where i strongly believe is the beginning of <strong>great</strong> things, considering that we now live in a <strong>digital age</strong>. I personally have found a space where
            my inner-child can <strong>thrive</strong> and <strong>engineer</strong> beautiful things that could potentially transform people's lives and possibly reach places beyond my comprehension. One of the things i long for is to be
            in a <strong>thriving</strong> environment, one that will constantly <strong>inspire</strong> growth and challenge me to be a better person each and every day.
         </p>

         <p class="paragraph">
            What i am realising now as a young adult is that we as people sometimes waste too much time trying to fit in our societies and end up losing ourselves in the process, instead of investing that very same time in our
            <strong>personal growth</strong> and in <strong>building our craft</strong>. Some people are fortunate enough to <strong>find</strong> and learn to <strong>forgive</strong> themselves in a very young age, in the process of that
            enlightenment they become <strong>reunited</strong> with their <strong>inner-child</strong> while they still have the time and energy to flourish and witness the manifestation of all that is in them and ultimately fulfil their
            purpose. But we don't all walk in the same shoes and that's okay... pursue rest, healing and self-awareness, find your way back to your most peaceful <strong>state of mind</strong>, if you've never experience that create a new
            reality for yourself, stop procrastinating, put in the time, persevere even in failure because trust me you will fail, sometimes more than once but you need to keep going because your <strong>well-being</strong> depends on it.
         </p>
         <p class="paragraph">
            In conclusion i strongly believe that the manifestation of all that is in you as a person does not necessarily mean it's all about you or your family, but it's about your community, your generation and the world at large. Great
            <strong>enlightenment</strong> comes with great <strong>responsibility</strong> and that responsibility gives you a sense of purpose which will later lead you to a happy and satisfying life... so whoever you are, wherever you
            are, spread your light and shine bright, give <strong>service</strong> to your generation and inspire the younger ones to be better people and <strong>teach</strong> them to lead a <strong>purpose</strong> driven life.
         </p>
